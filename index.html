  <!-- <h2>Profile</h2> -->
  <p>
  My focus is set on industries that are currently being transformed by AI 
  and companies that are seriously adopting AI into their own strategy.
  I am particularly interested in sound implementations of ML workflows.
  I am especially interested in industry domains where Deep Learning can be used
  to solve problems through computer vision techniques.
  I am prepared to provide technical direction in ML projects as well as to
  participate in the development of applications.
