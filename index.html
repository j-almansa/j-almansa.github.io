  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
  [My focus is set] into industries that are currently being transformed by AI 
  and companies that are seriously adopting AI into their own strategy.
  I am particularly interested in sound [implementations] of ML workflows.
  I am especially interested in industry domains where Deep Learning can be used
  to deal with [problems] amenable to computer vision techniques.
  I am prepared to provide technical direction in ML projects as well as to
  participate in the development of applications.
